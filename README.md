# User Guide

### Single User Mode
Single user mode is enabled by default so no extra settings required.

## Multi User Mode
In multi user mode all data is stored on the Baralga server backend. Multi user mode is enabled using the Java system property
`-DuserMode=multiuser` or the setting `userMode=multiuser` in the `application.properties`
stored in the directory `$USER_HOME\.baralga\application.properties`.

### Settings in Application Properties

```properties
# Mandatory for multiuser mode
userMode=multiuser

# Default value http://localhost:8080
backendURL=http://localhost:8080

# Default value is current system user
user=user

# Default value us3r
password=us3r
```
